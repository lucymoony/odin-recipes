        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (125 g), divided</li>
            <li>½ cup cold water (120 mL)</li>
            <li>8 raw shrimps, peeled and deveined, tails left on</li>
            <li>oil, for frying</li>
            <li>¾ cup dashi (180 g)</li>
            <li>¼ cup soy sauce (60 mL)</li>
            <li>¼ cup mirin (60 mL)</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups cooked rice (345 g), for serving</li>
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
            <li>1 roasted seaweed strip, cut into 8 equal pieces</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk the egg in a small bowl. Add ½ cup (60 g) of flour and the cold water and whisk to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining flour to a shallow dish. Dredge each shrimp in the flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350°F (180˚C).</li>
            <li>Dip the floured shrimp into the chilled batter.</li>
            <li>Fry the shrimp until they float to the top and are golden brown in color. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
            <li>In a medium pan, combine the dashi, soy sauce, and mirin, and bring to a boil over high heat. Transfer to a small bowl.</li>
            <li>To make the onigiri rice balls, first wet your palms with water and coat with a little bit of salt.</li>
            <li>Take a handful of rice and make an indent in the middle. Dip a shrimp into the soy sauce mixture, then place in the center of the rice. <br>Wrap the rice around the shrimp, creating a triangle shape.</li>
            <li>Wrap a strip of seaweed around the rice ball. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
