        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Homemade Chinese red bean buns with a soft and slightly sweet surface.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <h4>Red bean paste</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>½ cup red beans (pre-soaked)</li>
            <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
            <li>400 ml water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. butter or vegetable oil. (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Dough</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>300 g all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp instant yeast</li>
            <li>150 ml cold water or 180 ml milk</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <h4>Red bean paste</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Add water, sugar, and soaked red beans into a pot and cook. Transfer to a non-stick pan, and melt in butter (optional, you can use vegetable cooking oil too). <br>Stir fry until the paste can stick together.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Dough</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Add yeast and sugar in cold water or milk. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add flour and yeast water to a stand mixer and mix for around 1 minute at low speed. <br>Add vegetable oil (optional) and continue kneading for at least 10 minutes until the dough is super smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Take the dough out, slightly dust the surface you will use to roll out the dough, and then divide the dough into 8 portions.</li>
            <li>Take one portion out. Knead the dough for a couple of minutes, and then shape it into a smooth ball.</li>
            <li>Press down and then roll out slightly to a flat circle, then turn it over (so the smoother side is on the outside) and roll to get a thick bottom.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Assemble</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Place some of the red bean paste in the center, gather the dough slowly using the space between your thumb and forefinger, and then tear off the excess dough.</li>
            <li>Turn the bun over and shape it into a dome (a little bit higher than you want because it will flatten a little bit ). Repeat to finish the remaining buns.</li>
            <li>Line your steamer and place the buns one by one, with space among each other.</li>
            <li>Cover the lid and now let them start rising. The time depends on lots of factors, including the room temperature and then the moisture. <br>All we need to do is to watch the size of the dough. Your buns will be ready to steam when they are 1.5 times in size.</li>
            <li>When the buns are ready to steam, put the steamer in a pan with cold water and steam for around 13 minutes (on medium to low heat after the water starts to boil). <br>Then remove from heat and let it stand for 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
