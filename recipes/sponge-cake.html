        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Japanese sponge cake (<span lang="ja">スポンジケーキ</span>) is a very light and fluffy yellow-white cake that is a base component for a lot of Japanese Western-style sweets.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>20 g butter</li>
            <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
            <li>90 g cake flour</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>90 g sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F (180 C) at least 20 minutes before. Line a 7" (18 cm) cake pan with parchment paper (bottom and side). <br>Put butter and milk in a small bowl and microwave until the butter melts. In another bowl, sift the cake flour 2 times. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>In a bowl of a stand mixer, add eggs and sugar. Over a double boiler (placing the bowl over a pot with simmering water on low heat), <br>whisk the egg mixture until it becomes lukewarm (until the sugar dissolves). Then set the bowl on the stand mixer, and whip the egg mixture <br>until very thick (watch video to see the texture). Add vanilla.</li>
            <li>Add sifted cake flour in 3 parts. Fold in the first one-third of the flour by hand with a spatula. <br>After the flour is incorporated, add the next part of flour and again fold in with the spatula. Repeat with the last third of the flour. <br>Next, add the mixture of melted butter and milk and fold in with the spatula.</li>
            <li>Put the batter in the prepared pan. Bake for 20-25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take the cake out from the oven and leave for 15 minutes. Finally, remove the cake from the cake pan.</li>
        </ol>
